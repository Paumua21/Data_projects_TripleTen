| 1 | Nyc Airbnb Data| This project analyzes Manhattan's vacation rental market using Airbnb data to identify the top-performing neighborhoods and property types, revealing that one-bedroom units—especially in areas like Harlem—offer strong investment potential, with top listings such as one in Midtown generating up to $30,000 in a 30-day period. |

| 3 | Saving Superstore | The project task was to create Data Vizualisations for the company's profits vs losses, Advertising and Return items. |
